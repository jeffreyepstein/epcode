A NOTE ABOUT JAVASCRIPT CODE HERE

Some of the code here is old school. In some cases apps were built in a non-profit where most of my time was prioritized to CMS updates, so I had to build quickly with what I knew at the time.

I do know more modern methods, at least ECMAScript 2015 ("ES6"), and if I were coding today you would see "let", "const", (function(blah, bing) ...()) and so on...but I just do not have the time to re-write everything here.
